# Basic-Haskell-List-Operations

Here are a few Haskell list operations from my adventure to learn a new type of programming paradigm.

If you're new to Haskell, this repo is an excellent place to start exploring the language. I've provided simple but useful functions that demonstrate how Haskell can be used to manipulate lists of integers. I hope you find it helpful!

## About Haskell

[Haskell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell) is a programming language that puts a lot of emphasis on immutability, type safety, and functional programming. It has a reputation for having expressive syntax, a powerful type system, and a lazy evaluation approach that allows for efficient computation of infinite data structures.

In Haskell, we focus on composing functions rather than modifying them, which results in code that is more concise and easier to reason about. Additionally, Haskell's type system catches errors at compile time, helping us prevent bugs that might otherwise occur during runtime.

Thanks to [Professor Graham Hutton](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/) for getting me interested in this language.
